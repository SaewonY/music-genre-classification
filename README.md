# music-genre-classifier-convNet

</br>

This repository's idea is based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04363.pdf)

We are going to create a end-to-end Convolution Neural Network approach to distinguish between different "Musics".

Keras is used in this jupyter notebook.

The Music genre we are to distinguish are based on **FMA: A DATASET FOR MUSIC ANALYSIS** which is available from this site <https://github.com/mdeff/fma>

</br>

Data consists of 8 different genres which are:

1. Hip-Hop

2. Pop

3. Folk

4. Experimental

5. Rock

6. International

7. Electronic

8. Instrumental

</br>

## Data

* `music_analysis.csv`: music file name followed by 8 genre classes.

* [fma_small_zip](https://os.unil.cloud.switch.ch/fma/fma_small.zip): 8,000 tracks of 30s, 8 balanced genres (GTZAN-like) (7.2 GiB)
