# music-genre-classifier-convNet

</br>

</br>

This repository's idea is based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04363.pdf)

We are going to create a Convolution Neural Network to distinguish between different "Musics".

Keras is used in this jupyter notebook.

The Music genre we are to distinguish are based on **FMA: A DATASET FOR MUSIC ANALYSIS** which is available from this site <https://github.com/mdeff/fma>
